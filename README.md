# Julia Bug: Unexpected Exponentiation Results

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Julia code involving the exponentiation operator (`^`) with negative numbers. The bug arises from the element-wise nature of the operator, leading to unintended results. The solution provides a corrected version that addresses this issue.

## Bug Description:

The original Julia function `myfunction` intends to return the square of a number, regardless of whether the number is positive or negative. However, when a negative number is passed as an argument, the `^` operator does not correctly perform squaring and produces unexpected results.

## Solution:

The solution uses the `^2` operator appropriately, ensuring correct squaring of both positive and negative numbers, thereby resolving the unexpected results issue.
